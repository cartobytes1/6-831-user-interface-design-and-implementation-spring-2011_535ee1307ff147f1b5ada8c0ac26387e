The purpose of this activity is to explore the undo models used in single-user text editing. You will find a few different kinds of textboxes below. Experiment with your web browser's undo model for text editing by typing, deleting, changing properties, and using Undo. Try to figure out:

*   how many undo **streams** are thereâ€”one, or many?
*   how is the history divided into undoable **units**?
*   how much **previous state** is recovered when you undo? (selections? cursor positions?)
*   what **visible feedback** does Undo give? (e.g., if the Undo affects a location scrolled out of the box?)

I never saw a Purple Cow, I never hope to see one. But I can tell you, anyhow, I'd rather see than be one.

_Apres Cinq Ans,_1914

Ah, yes, I wrote the "Purple Cow"--  
I'm sorry, now, I wrote it!  
But I can tell you anyhow,  
I'll kill you if you quote it.
