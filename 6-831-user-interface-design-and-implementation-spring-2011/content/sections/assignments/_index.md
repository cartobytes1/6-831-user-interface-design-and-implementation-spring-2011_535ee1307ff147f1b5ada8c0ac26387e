Five problem sets (HW, PS/RS) are assigned, which you must complete individually, not in a group. HW1–2 ("homework") are assigned to both courses. PS1–3 ("programming") are assigned only to the undergraduate course 6.813. RS1–3 ("research") are assigned only to the graduate course 6.831. These five assignments will constitute 30% of your grade.
